# Interop 2022

This repository is for discussing proposals relating to the Interop
2022 project.

The overall process and timeline for decision making is given by [wpt
RFC 99](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/compat_2022/rfcs/compat_2022.md).

For each proposed Interop 2022 focus area:
 * First check for an existing issue covering that area. We are aiming
   to consolidate discssion for each proposal in a single issue.

* If no issue exists, file a new issue. The issue title should
   clearly describe the feature being proposed for inclusion. The body
   of the issue should outline the reason for including the issue and should include:

  - A link to the relevant specification document

  - A link to relevant testcases (assuming they exist)

  - Supporting data for including the feature as part of an interop
    effort e.g. evidence of significant developer interest in the
    feature, or evidence of site breakage caused by implementation
    differences in the feature.

  - Links to any existing discussion or vendor signals e.g. in browser
    project bug trackers.
