# The Interop Project

Welcome to the Interop project, an ongoing effort to make the web more interoperable in key areas, prioritized by web developer and user needs. This is part of [the web-platform-tests project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), the main test suite for the web platform.

Please see the [Interop 2023](./2023/README.md) for the current iteration of the project!
