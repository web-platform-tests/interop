# Interop 2023

Interop 2023 is an effort to increase interoperability across browsers in key technical areas that are of high priority to web developers and end users. It's part of the [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) (WPT) project — an automated test suite for web standards — and run by a team of representatives from companies that make substantial contributions to browser rendering engines.

Similar to [Interop 2022](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022), the tests selected will be continuously run on automated testing infrastructure. The test pass rates for each browser rendering engine will be displayed on the Interop 2023 Dashboard — displaying the percentage of passing tests in each chosen area, and an overall total score. The dashboard will also display scores for group progress on particular Investigation Efforts selected for the Interop team to work on throughout the year.

Interop 2023 is tightly focused on technology that is already specified in web standards. This is not a place to invent new web technology, nor solve complex problems that need web standards. That work should happen in the standards bodies.
