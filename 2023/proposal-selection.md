# Interop 2023 Proposal Selection

This is a summary of how the [proposal selection](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/interop_2023.md#proposal-selection) process for Interop 2023 worked in practice, and how to understand the outcome.

During the proposal period, we received a lot of proposals, many more than last year. After initial proposal review and refinement some proposals were split, resulting in [87 proposals](https://github.com/orgs/web-platform-tests/projects/2) to evaluate. This was fantastic, but also meant that we needed a bit more time than we initially planned to finalize and announce the project.

As a starting point, we wanted to include all proposals that we had [consensus](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/interop_2023.md#governance) on within the interop team. This was determined by each organization reviewing proposals and deciding on a position for each:

- **Include**: Include in Interop 2023. Interpreted as "Support" in establishing consensus per the RFC.
- **Neutral**: No position. Interpreted as neither supporting nor opposing the proposal.
- **Exclude**: Don't include in Interop 2023. Interpreted as "Oppose" in establishing consensus per the RFC.

Positions were then shared within the interop team, and resulted in 33 Focus Area proposals and 2 Investigation Effort proposals being tentatively accepted.

The proposals were then grouped into a smaller number of Focus Areas, and additionally some Focus Areas from Interop 2022 were carried forward. The result is the 26 active focus areas and 2 investigation efforts for Interop 2023. Previous focus areas are still tracked but will not be part of the Interop 2023 score.

The result is a set of features that we believe are important for web developers and users, and the organizations behind Interop 2023 are coming together to improve these in 2023.
