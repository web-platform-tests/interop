      Thanks for making an Interop 2024 Proposal

      Be sure to read the [requirements and guidance](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/README.md#requirements-for-focus-area-proposals) to give your proposal the best chance of success!

      If this feature is widely implemented, but lacks a high quality specification or tests, an [Investigation Effort](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/new?template=investigation-effort-proposal.yml) may be more appropriate.

      Timeline for Interop 2024 planning:

      - Public call for proposals - September 14, 2023 to October 5, 2023
      - Proposal review by the Interop team, with an opportunity for refinement
      - Selection of proposals by the Interop team, based on consensus
      - Public launch in January 2024
