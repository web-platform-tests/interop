      Thanks for taking the time to make a proposal for Interop 2025!

      This form is for features that are widely implemented, but lack high quality specifications or tests. If this feature does have a high quality specification and tests, please file a [Focus Area](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/new?template=focus-area-proposal.yml) proposal instead. If you're not sure which kind of proposal to submit, pick one and we will help you out.

      When you submit your proposal, a GitHub issue will be created to track it. Please check back on GitHub from time to time to answer any questions we have. You'll also be able to make changes to your proposal from now until October 3 by commenting on your issue. See our [README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/2025/README.md) for the full timeline of Interop 2025.

    description: |
      Reasons for including the feature. A few dimensions to consider are:

      - Web developer sentiment from polls or surveys, for example, [MDN surveys](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/) or [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/).
      - Examples of sites or libraries working around a missing feature or browser bug.
      - Browser bugs or browser bug statistics, for example, [Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/), [Gecko](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/),  or [WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/).
      - Current usage of the feature, for example, [Chrome use counters](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/popularity) or [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/).

      Please describe the steps necessary to get this feature to a state of high quality specification and tests. Link to existing spec and tests, and describe what needs to be done, ideally as a set of distinct tasks. If there are open-ended questions about the behavior that require investigation, try to still capture this as a set of tasks, such as "test existing behavior", "update specification", and "update tests".

      Any standards work must be done in the appropriate standards group, and those doing the work need to join that group. Interop 2025 is not a venue for specifying new features.
