      Thanks for taking the time to make a proposal for Interop 2023!

      Please see the [Interop 2023 README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/2023/README.md) for the timeline and what to expect from the process.

      **Please make sure you're using the right proposal template!** If this feature has a high quality specification and tests, submit a [Focus Area](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/new?template=focus-area-proposal.yml) proposal instead.

    description: |
      Reasons for including the feature. A few dimensions to consider are:

      - Web developer sentiment from polls or surveys, for example, [MDN surveys](https://insights.developer.mozilla.org/) or [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/).
      - Examples of sites or libraries working around a missing feature or browser bug.
      - Browser bugs or browser bug statistics, for example, [Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/), [Gecko](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/),  or [WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/).
      - Current usage of the feature, for example, [Chrome use counters](https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/popularity) or [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/).

      Please describe the steps necessary to get this feature to a state of high quality specification and tests. Link to existing spec and tests, and describe what needs to be done, ideally as a set of distinct tasks. If there are open-ended questions about the behavior that require investigation, try to still capture this as a set of tasks, such as "test existing behavior", "update specification", and "update tests".

      Any standards work must be done in the appropriate standards group, and those doing the work need to join those groups. Interop 2023 is not a venue for specifying new features.
